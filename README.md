# Diabetes Patient Hospital Outcome Classification

This repository contains a solution for a diabetes classification problem using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms. The dataset utilized for this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Diabetes 130-US Hospitals for years 1999-2008](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008).

## Overview

The project aims to build and evaluate machine learning models to predict hospital outcomes for diabetes patients based on historical data. The models employed include:

- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
